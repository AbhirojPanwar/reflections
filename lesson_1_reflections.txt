diff compares two files line by line
and helps us to check where the code has changed,
which is used to pinpoint the change in the code
causing to throw an error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

having easy access can let me to check out all the changes to the code,
and there will not be any problem for me to make quick changes to the code
and apply it with out any problem because as all versions of my file
will be saved up somewhere

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Pros:- we have control on what to save. We can save anytime we want
 Cn?:- Fuck this shit who cares??

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
 files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans:- To track all the changes happening in a file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Because IT takes Snapshot of every commit toa file, which can help us to keep
a check on that



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because there is an option of always returning back to previous cchanges

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
making my repository
